### What is closure?
> Closures are self-contained blocks of functinality that can be PASSED around and USED in your code

1. -> Closure is a 1st class Object

> Closures can CAPTURE and STORE REFERENCES to any constants and variables from the CONTEXT which they ayre defined

2. -> by reference mean not value, means, If we change any thing inside the closure, the object outsite the closure will also be affected

> Closures are Reference Types

3. -> If I assign a cloure to two var, they actually refer to the same closure
